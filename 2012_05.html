							<td valign="top"><p>This past December, our <a href="http://www.interiordesign.net/article/537193-Away_From_it_All.php">North Beach Residence</a> was awarded  a "Best of the Year" award from Interior Design Magazine.  This award is a big deal in the industry, and follows on the heels of the National AIA Honor Award the project received earlier in the year.  What we love about Interior Design magazine is how it presents work with blurred boundaries between "Architecture" and "Interior Design" – to the point of making the distinction itself seem ridiculous.  On this project we collaborated with an owner with decades of experience and dozens of awards for her work as an interior designer.  The result embodies the blurring of boundaries we so love in the work featured in the magazine. <br><br></p></td>

					<h3 style="margin-top:20px;">MORE RECOGNITION</h3>
					<p>Two other Heliotrope projects, our yet-to-be-built Passive House project and our Suncrest Residence, were recently recognized with <a href="http://www.aianwpr.org/RDA2011/RDA%20presentn.pdf">Merit Awards (PDF)</a> in the AIA NW & Pacific Region Honor Awards program presented this past December in Tokyo.  We couldn’t be more thrilled with the recognition given by this jury of internationally known architects, and hope to see our un-built Passive House project break ground soon.  Toward that end, should you know of anyone interested in owning an award winning home on Green Lake that is also one of the ‘greenest’ homes in the city, please have them give us a call.<br><br></p>

					<h3 style="margin-top:20px;">IN THE WORKS</h3>
					<p>We are fortunate to have many exciting new projects "on the boards" at the moment, including several new residences in the San Juans, a new home on Portage Bay and four buzz-worthy restaurants.  Two of these include:<br></p>

					<h3>Joule</h3>
					<p>The award-winning husband and wife cooking team of Rachel Yang and Seif Chirchi are moving their Seattle restaurant, Joule, from its current Wallingford location to the new "Fremont Collective" development on Stone Way, and we are proud to be their Architect. The new Joule will be a contemporary, urban space offering the Korean-inflected French-American dishes their followers have come to love. The Wallingford Joule closes at the end of April and the new Joule will be open later this summer. Seattle Magazine calls it one of Seattle’s best restaurants.</p>

					<h3>Shanik</h3>
					<p>For fans of Vij’s Indian restaurant in Vancouver, you will be happy (ecstatic even?) to hear that Meeru Dhalwala, co-owner of and creative force behind the incredible menu at Vij’s, will be opening a new restaurant venture in Seattle – her first outside of Vancouver.  The new restaurant, to be called Shanik after Meeru’s younger daughter, will be located in the South Lake Union neighborhood and is scheduled to open late this year.  Fans of Vij’s restaurant range from Anthony Bordain to writers at the NY Times.  Vij’s is known not only for the quality of the food, but also for the hospitality and graciousness of the proprietors.   We are huge fans and are honored be a part of this new venture. <br><br>
